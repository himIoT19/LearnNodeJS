1. Run application using below command:
$ nodemon index.js 
[nodemon] 2.0.5
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node index.js`
Listening on port 3000...

2. Since we have not set environment variable for PORT. Set it using command below:
(Ubuntu)
$ export PORT=<port_number>
(Windows)
$ set PORT=<port_number>

3. Again run the same application:
$ nodemon index.json
[nodemon] 2.0.5
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node index.js`
Listening on port 5000...
